# UWinnipeg-Guide-Coating-Lab-Simulations
This is a summary of the contents of this github repo, and how you could clone the repository to run my simulations yourself. This includes all STL files, PENTrack configuration and materials files, automated scripts for creating a large number of simulations, and analysis scripts written in python used to analyze the data for my undergraduate honours thesis at the University of Winnipeg under Dr. Russell Mammei. Thesis can be made available upon request to [myemail](thomashepworth12@gmail.com)
