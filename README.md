# UWinnipeg-Guide-Coating-Lab-Simulations
This is a summary of the contents of this github repo, and how you could clone the repository to run my simulations yourself. This includes all STL files, PENTrack configuration and materials files, automated scripts for creating a large number of simulations, and analysis scripts written in python used to analyze the data for my undergraduate honours thesis at the University of Winnipeg under Dr. Russell Mammei. Questions can be directed to me via [my email](mailto:thomashepworth12@gmail.com). 










## Summary of Contents 

### PENTrack_Simulation_Procedures_2025
This is a document written and edited by many past and current members of the TUCAN collaboration including R. Picker, S. Sidhu, S. Lan, and K. Drury. It describes how members of TUCAN can use computecanada for PENTrack simulations. TUCAN students will need a computecanada account if they are doing a PENTrack project. To have a new account set up, contact R. Picker at TRIUMF. Note this document is not nessecarily reflecting of the most updated version of PENTrack, which can be found on the [PENTrack Github](https://github.com/wschreyer/PENTrack/tree/master). When in doubt, rely on the information of the most updated version of the PENTrack Github.
### JPARC_Simulation_Model
This folder contains the STL files used for 1m long DLC guide storage experiment simulations at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex [(J-PARC)](https://j-parc.jp/c/en/). It also contains a picture of the model for reference. If you are interested in modify this model for a future TUCAN experiment at J-PARC, I can share the Solidworks Assembly. 

### Benchmark_STL
This folder contains the STL files for a benchmarking model used for analytical testing of PENTrack, as described in my honours thesis. It also contains a picture of the model for reference. This is a great way to learn PENTrack and understand what it is simulating.
