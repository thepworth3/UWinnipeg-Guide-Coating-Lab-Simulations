### Notice:
This folder will eventually contain the 3D model of the TRIUMF guide setup, as was installed in May 2025. This will be able to serve as a baseline, along with other configuration files to be provided if someone wanted to implement the PENTrack simulations for a TRIUMF storage experiment, similar to that of the J-PARC experiments.
